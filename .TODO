Tagging?

Ensure event end is after event start
 - Default should be same start, grey out days before

Declare variables like club time/location/contact details easily and propagate

Improvements
 - URL should link to home when editing, and to live site when on home
 - There should be an option to change publish to submit
 - Highlight posts which are scheduled to be published in the future
 - Option to change publish button to submit or something
    - Also hide publish and make new
 - Resize/compress\downscale/crop images on upload
 - list vs grid view is kinda useless. Maybe if theres's a cover image show it in grid view
 - Show title in bold in list view
