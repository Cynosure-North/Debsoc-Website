The Society was formed in 1899, in anticipation of the opening of the new Victoria College, part of the then University of New Zealand. Students who formed the Debating Society also went on to form the Victoria Students’ Association.

The Society has a long record of participation and success on the international stage. Teams from the Society have made the Grand Final of the Australasian Intervarsity Debating Championships in two of the last three years. At the end of 2008, a team from the Society reached the semi-finals of the World Universities’ Debating Championships. In 2007, a team from Victoria won the Cambridge Union IV and reached the final of the Oxford IV. The Society is currently ranked as the 19th best university in the world at debating.

The Society is a non-profit incorporated society, a registered New  Zealand charity, and an affiliated club within the Victoria University  of Wellington Students’ Association. It is led by an Executive Committee of eleven members, and governed by a constitution, which you can find linked below The Society is heavily involved with debating and public speaking  events around Wellington, participating in a number of public debates  for various organisations and taking a leading role in organising  debating at a secondary school level.

We meet every Wednesday in KK303 at 6:30pm. Come along, no experience necessary

# Our Events

## The Great Debate
The Great Debate is Debsoc’s annual fundraiser. It features a comedy debate with comedians and other public figures and a number of prizes and giveaways. Featured in Orientation Week, this event is one of the best ways to get out and have some fun O-Week style.
IGM and Intro Night

Always scheduled for the Wednesday of the 2nd week of Uni, the IGM and Intro Night is the time for seeing what Debsoc is all about, meeting lots of new people, and learning a little bit about debating. The  evening features pizza, a show debate and a bar tab in town afterwards. This evening is also the time when the first year representative for Committee is elected.

## Mid-Year Dinner
Debsoc’s mid-year dinner is held at at a cheap Wellington BYO restaurant and always seems to be attended by a good number of wine bottles. This event farewells the first trimester, and gets the soceity together for one last time before the holidays.
Regressive Debate

A regressive debate starts with the adjudication and progresses  backwards from there, all the way to the chairperson welcoming everyone  to the debate. As you’ll expect this event is absolutely hilarious.  Audience participation guaranteed; and the debaters have usually had some liquid refreshments in advance to make things funnier/more debauched.

## AGM
The Annual General Meeting of the Society is an important event at  the end of the year. The President and Treasurer report on the year, and the committee for the following year is elected. Whether you are running for committee or not, make sure you come along – there’ll be pizza, and possibly political intrigue!

## End of Year Party

Debsoc’s famous final event of the year. It’ll have a theme, and dressing up is compulsory. This is a great event for having a lot of fun spending the Debsoc bar tab and relaxing one last time before exams start. It’ll be held in a bar in town.
